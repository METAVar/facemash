                              This is just simple implementation of the mark zuckerberg 'facemash' in python language, where player's are simulated to play based on the computer generated random activity.Each player has got four entity [won,lost,score,played]. The game play starts with one-player against another who ever wins/loose, there corresponding entity get updated,the expectedChance(Elo Rating system ) and k-factor determines the updated score of the player, Those who don't
